# PlayToday Media Player

A completely local, private media player for your own files.  
No tracking, no ads, no internet required after the initial load.

Just a single HTML file that runs in your browser. Play music, videos, drag/drop files or folders, search playlist, dark mode—everything happens locally on your device.

### Quick Start (Works on iPhone, iPad, Windows, Mac, Linux, Android)

1. Open this link in your browser: https://jonathanallsup.github.io/PlayToday/
2. Let it load fully.
3. Save it as a shortcut/bookmark for easy access:
   - It works immediately—no install needed.
   - For a more "app-like" feel, follow the platform steps below.

### iPhone / iPad (Safari – feels like a real app)
1. Open the link in Safari.
2. Tap Share → Add to Home Screen.
3. Open the new icon once while online (caches everything).
4. Done! Use it anytime—works offline after first load.
   **Bonus:** Turn off WiFi to see it still plays perfectly (as long as you've opened it once before).  
   (Tip: Open it occasionally to keep the cache fresh.)

### Windows / Mac / Linux (Chrome, Edge, Firefox – recommended browsers)
1. Open the link in Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.
2. To make it feel like a standalone app:
   - **Chrome / Edge**: Click the three dots menu → "Install PlayToday" (or More tools → Create shortcut → check "Open as window").
   - **Firefox**: No direct install, but bookmark it and open in a new window (Ctrl+N or Cmd+N) for a clean look.
3. The app icon/shortcut will open in its own window (no browser tabs/address bar).
4. Works offline after first load—just like on iOS.

### Android Phones / Tablets (Chrome recommended)
1. Open the link in Chrome.
2. Tap the three dots menu → Add to home screen.
3. Open the new icon once while online.
4. Done! Launches full-screen like a native app.
5. Works offline after first load (same bonus as iOS—try turning off data/WiFi).
